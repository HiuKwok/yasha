Version 4.0

Major release, unreleased

- Reverted the change introduced in version 3.0 to use uppercase `-E`
  and `-V` option flags for extension and variable files. Also fixes
  the SCons builder, which was still using lowercase options.
- Template variables given as part of the command-line call are now
  given in form of long option, i.e. `--foo bar` or `--foo=bar`,
  instead of `-v foo bar`. All unknown long options which has a value
  are interpreted as a template variable.
- Python literals can be used in template variables given as part of
  the call, e.g. `--foo "['bar', 'baz']"`.
- Added new command-line option `-c` to set template encoding.
  Default is UTF-8.
- Added `env` built-in filter to read environment variable in template.
- Added `shell` built-in filter to run a shell command and to connect
  to its stdout in template. Requires Python >= 3.5.
- Added `subprocess` built-in filter to spawn new processes, but unlike
  shell it returns a CompletedProcess instance, or CalledProcessError
  in case of error if check was set False. Requires Python >= 3.5.
- Removed overwrite protection for variable/extension file. Caused more
  confusion than protection.
- Command-line option `--no-variables` is now `--no-variable-file`.
- Command-line option `--no-extensions` is now `--no-extension-file`.
- Fixed issue where command-line call `yasha ../template.j2` looked up
  template companion files till root folder `/`.


Version 3.1

Minor release

- Support JSON formatted variable files.
- Prevent misoverwrition of the variable/extension file by the
